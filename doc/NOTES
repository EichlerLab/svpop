Autism Quad svpop directory:
/net/eichler/vol27/projects/autism_genome_assembly/nobackups/sv/svpop

Source types:
caller: One caller for one sample
callerset: Merged callers for one sample
Sampleset: Merge samples (can merge callers or callersets)

Example: The quad creatse a callerset for each sample, and then merges each callerset into a sampleset.

Path to variant calls:
results/variant/{sourcetype}/{sourcename}/bed/{sample}/{varset}/{filter}/byref/{vartype}_{svtype}.bed

Common wildcards:
* sourcetype: “caller”, “callerset”, or “sampleset” depending on the state of merging.
* sourcename: Variant caller name or merged set name.
* sample: Sample name or sample list name for a sampleset.
* varset: Variant calls subset by some filter. Usually “all” or “notrsd”.
* filter: Quality filtering. We use “lc” for this project.
* vartype: “sv” or “indel”
* svtype: “ins”, “del”, “inv”, or “dup”

For callersets, a dash in the sample name delimits a wildcard that gets parsed into "{id}" within a sample list. For example, "quad-14455" will find sample list "quad" and substitute "14455" for "{id}". This way, many samplesets with a similar structure.


Config JSON:
* variant_table: Path to a table with columns SOURCE SAMPLE DATA and VERSION
  * SOURCE: smrtsv, pbsv, sniffles, or phasedsv
  * SAMPLE: Sample name
  * DATA: SMRT-SV run directory (for SMRT-SV) or the input VCF (for the others)
  * VERSION: Required only for SMRT-SV, and should be 2 for your samples (SMRT-SV v2). Helps the pipeline find data.
* reference: Reference all variant calls are made against
* callerset: Callerset definitions
* samplelist: Sample list definitions for samplesets
* sampleset: Sampleset definitions. Defines where to pull variants and how to merge them.
* variant_extern: Load external BED for callers other than SMRT-SV, PBSV, Sniffles, and Phased-SV
  * SV sequence in FASTAs for sequence-resolved callers
* filter_def: Define aliases for complex filters that can be used for "filter" wildcards
* merge_def: Define shorthand aliases for merge definitions.
* smrtsv_map: Define mapping parameters for calling DUPs and large DELs based on read alignments generated by SMRT-SV
* genotype: Define genotype sets. This can read SMRT-SV genotyper results and pull them in as annotations.
