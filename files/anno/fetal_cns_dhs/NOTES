DHS sensitive sites in fetal brain CNS.

Downloaded CNS DHS sites from:
/net/eichler/vol27/projects/simons_illumina_genome_project/nobackups/in_backups/annotation/CNS_DHS_b38.bed.gz

See Turner 2016 (10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.11.023)

File is likely the latest? This is the best one I found in various Simons projects (Pete Audano).
